## Running the URL Test Suite

When upgrading `tldts-experimental`, it's important to ensure that everything is functioning as expected. To do this, run the URL test suite. The `npm test` command includes URL regression tests as part of the process. Additionally, it is highly recommended to execute `scripts/run-url-regression.js` after performing any upgrades to `tldts` to verify that the changes haven't introduced any regressions.
